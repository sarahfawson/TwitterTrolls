# Twitter Trolls Sentiment Analysis
## Group Project for GWU Analytics & Visualization Bootcamp

For our first class group project, we were required to use several aspects of what we had learned in 8 weeks of coding in python, to analyze a topic of our choice. Our team found a dataset of 3 million russian troll tweets on Kaggle that was put together by 2 professors at Clemson university and used in a FiveThirtyEight article. We were inspired by the topic and wanted to see if there were any other findings we could report from the data. Specifically, we aimed to analyze the sentiment of the tweets to see if there was a strategy the trolls used in terms of how they talked about certain topics and how they endorsed Donald Trump or perhaps used fear mongering tactics or negative sentiment in tweets to sow division among a left-leaning audience.

Below are some resources we used to kick off this project and a link to our final presentation. 

In this repository you will find the data cleaning and VADER scoring code which I built with a partner, as well as my section of the analysis that used Natural Language Processing to focus on specific topics that the Russian Twitter trolls used in their right-leaning audience accounts and their left-leaning audience accounts.
